# Batch Management Guide

This folder contains batch-specific materials for 4 different student batches (G1, G2, G3, G4).

## 📁 Batch Structure

```
batches/
├── g1/rough/           # Batch G1 - Morning Batch
├── g2/rough/           # Batch G2 - Afternoon Batch
├── g3/rough/           # Batch G3 - Evening Batch
└── g4/rough/           # Batch G4 - Weekend Batch
```

## 🎯 Purpose of Rough Folders

The `rough/` folders in each batch contain:

- **Class notes and examples** from live sessions
- **Last working code** from each session
- **Quick reference files** for that specific batch
- **Session-specific rough work** that students can refer to

## 📝 File Naming Convention for Rough Files

### Session-Based Naming

```
01-simple-array-questions.js      # Session 1 content
02-function-basics.js            # Session 2 content
03-async-programming.js          # Session 3 content
04-express-server-setup.js       # Session 4 content
05-express-routing.js            # Session 5 content
...and so on
```

### Topic-Based Naming (Alternative)

```
01-variables-datatypes.js        # Variables and data types
02-functions-arrow.js           # Functions and arrow functions
03-arrays-methods.js            # Array methods
04-objects-destructuring.js     # Objects and destructuring
05-promises-async-await.js      # Promises and async/await
...and so on
```

## 🚀 Usage Guidelines

### Before Each Class

1. **Check the last rough file** from the previous session
2. **Prepare the next sequential file** for the current session
3. **Review the main module content** for that topic

### During Class

1. **Start with rough file** from previous session (if continuing)
2. **Create new rough file** for current session
3. **Save working code** as you progress
4. **Add comments** explaining concepts

### After Each Class

1. **Save the final working code** in the rough file
2. **Add a brief summary** of what was covered
3. **Note any important concepts** or gotchas
4. **Prepare for next session**

## 🔄 Maintenance Tasks

### Weekly Tasks

- [ ] Review rough files from all batches
- [ ] Update any outdated examples
- [ ] Clean up temporary files
- [ ] Ensure sequential numbering

### Monthly Tasks

- [ ] Archive old rough files
- [ ] Update batch-specific notes
- [ ] Review and update examples
- [ ] Check for consistency across batches

## 📚 Best Practices

### File Organization

1. **One file per session** - don't mix topics
2. **Clear file names** - include session number and topic
3. **Consistent structure** - same format across batches
4. **Regular cleanup** - remove outdated files

### Content Quality

1. **Working code** - ensure all examples run
2. **Clear comments** - explain what each part does
3. **Progressive complexity** - build from simple to complex
4. **Real examples** - use practical scenarios

### Batch Management

1. **Consistent pace** - maintain similar progress across batches
2. **Regular check-ins** - monitor batch progress
3. **Flexible approach** - adapt to batch needs
4. **Documentation** - keep notes of batch-specific issues

## 🚨 Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Files getting mixed up between batches

**Solution**: Always work in the correct batch folder, double-check path

### Issue: Sequential numbering getting out of sync

**Solution**: Use a consistent numbering system, update README regularly

### Issue: Rough files becoming too large

**Solution**: Split into smaller files, archive old content

### Issue: Inconsistent naming across batches

**Solution**: Establish clear naming convention, stick to it
